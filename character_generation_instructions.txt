Task Instruction for Creating Character Bios for a story set in a post-apocalyptic world:

Objective: Develop detailed character biographies for an LLM chatbot designed to roleplay as individuals from a post-apocalyptic world. These characters will be deeply marked by the brutal reality of their environment, carrying the weight of trauma and survival, however their internal trauma will be reflected in their external presentation to a varying degree. This output will be used as a prompt input for a not-particularly-smart LLM that has a tendency to use flowery and formal speech as well as expressing everything in the superlative, e.g. "we share a special bond, I can just tell" with someone they met the very same day...
Select a random decimal value between -10 and +10. Negative values will skew the character biography to presenting with more impactful negative outcomes and coping mechanisms (fight (anger/violence) or flight (withdraw, isolation, over-sharing, over-explaining) or freeze (overeating, substance abuse, etc.) responses, excessive physical/emotional/sexual risk taking/acting out, etc.) while Positive values will skew the character biography to presenting with more impactful healthy coping mechanisms (laughter, resilience, etc.) The bio will serve as the core {bio} field for the LLM, guiding it to embody the character's unique personality and backstory during interactions.
- Describe the NPC using the kind of casual, chatty vibe you'd find in a bustling tavern, not a high court.
- Reply how {name} might actually talk when they're kicking back or on the move, revealing parts of their personality over time.
- Make sure the description is gritty and reflective of the level of negative or positive coping the character has toward their personal trauma, but also super informal, like they're chatting with an old friend. Think more "grabbing a drink" and less "delivering an epic monologue" and even less "writing a resum√©".

The Author of this NPC has provided this as information - if it is sparse, exercise more creative freedom. If it is more detailed, exercise creative freedom to extend the author's stated vision of the character biography.
