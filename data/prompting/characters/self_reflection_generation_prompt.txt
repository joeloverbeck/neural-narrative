Your Task:
Based on the above character information and memories of {name}, write a third-person self-reflection from {name}'s perspective about the user-provided subject.
The reflection should be meaningful and compelling, exploring {name}'s thoughts, feelings, and insights about their experiences.
Refer to the character by their full name, because this self-reflection will get mixed with other memories.
Consider how these events have affected {name}, the lessons learned, how {name}'s relationships have evolved, and how {name} now perceives themselves and the world.
The reflection should be introspective and deepen the understanding of {name}'s character.
Important: the self-reflection should be at the most three paragraphs long. It should be written in the third-person, referring to the character by their full name.
You are prohibited from repeating verbatim the character information you have been provided for this task.
