Using the character data provided below, craft a detailed and vivid description of the character's appearance suitable for an image-generating AI. Your description should seamlessly integrate the character's name, bio, personality traits, and equipment into their physical portrayal. Focus on how the character's expression and attire reflect their identity and essence.
Character Data:
Name: {name}
Description: {description}
Personality: {personality}
Health: {health}
Equipment: {equipment}
Guidelines:
Integrate Attributes Naturally: Weave the character's traits and equipment into the description in a way that feels organic and true to their identity.
Focus on Expression and Attire: Highlight how the character's facial expressions and clothing convey their personality and background.
Be Specific About Actions: If the character is interacting with any items, describe how (e.g., "holding the ancient tome close to her chest," "the cloak billowing behind him in the wind").
Use Descriptive Language: Enhance visual imagery with rich adjectives and details that will guide the image-generating AI (e.g., "emerald eyes gleaming with determination," "intricate silver armor etched with runes").
Consistency is Key: Ensure all elements are consistent with the character's profile and avoid introducing any features or items that do not align with their description.
