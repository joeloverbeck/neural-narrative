Based on the information provided, write two or three sentences of ambient narration, in the present tense, that enhances the scene without interfering with the ongoing dialogue.
The narration should incorporate elements of the surroundings to ground the dialogue and add verisimilitude. That can include elements of the physical setting, what people are doing there, or a mix of both.
The narration should be dynamic, instead of still descriptions of the surroundings. If the description of the setting offers details of the outside and the inside, use your judgement when assuming whether the characters are inside or outside.
Avoid repeating elements of the setting description verbatim: just use them as inspiration to do something original.
Avoid repeating previous lines of narration present in the transcription. Provide variety.
