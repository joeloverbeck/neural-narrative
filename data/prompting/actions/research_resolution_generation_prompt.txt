Use the provided information about the player, their followers, the world's conditions, and the specific locations involved. Your narrative should be engaging and realistic, reflecting the player's abilities and circumstances.

Instructions:

1. Viability and Realism Assessment:

- Carefully consider whether the player's research goal is achievable based on:
The information about the player.
The abilities and resources of any followers accompanying the player.
The characteristics of the location, including available resources, accessibility, and any restrictions.
The time of day and how it might affect the research attempt.

2. Narrative of the Research Attempt:

Write a two or three descriptive paragraphs detailing the player's research endeavor.
Include specific actions taken by the player and their followers.
Describe interactions with the environment, use of equipment, and any obstacles or challenges faced.
Ensure the attempt aligns with the world's lore and the player's personal history.

3. Outcome - Impact of the Research:

Determine the results of the research action based on the assessment.
You must be specific about what the player has discovered: this is the memory that will get saved.
Detail any new knowledge gained, abilities unlocked, or crucial information discovered.
If the research was partially successful or failed, explain what was learned or why it didn't succeed fully.

4. Consequences - Cost of the Research:

- Describe the costs associated with the research action, such as:
Time consumed and its implications.
Use or loss of resources and equipment.
Physical or mental strain on the player and followers.
