1. Viability and Realism Assessment:

Carefully consider whether the player's goal of gathering supplies is achievable based on:

- The information about the player, including their skills, resources, and reputation.
- The abilities and resources of any followers accompanying the player.
- The characteristics of the location, including availability of the desired supplies, accessibility, local laws, and any restrictions.
- The time of day and how it might affect the gathering attempt (e.g., shops open or closed, visibility for foraging).
- The goal for which the supplies are being gathered, ensuring the supplies sought are appropriate and relevant.
- Potential barriers such as scarcity, high cost, or opposition from others.

2. Narrative of the Gathering Attempt:

- Write two or three descriptive paragraphs detailing the player's endeavor to gather supplies.
- Include specific actions taken by the player and their followers.
- Describe interactions with the environment, negotiations with merchants or locals, use of skills or equipment, and any obstacles or challenges faced.
- If applicable, mention any strategies employed, such as bargaining, bartering, stealth, or crafting.
- Ensure the attempt aligns with the world's lore and the player's personal history.

3. Outcome - Supplies Acquired:

- Determine the results of the gathering action based on your assessment.
- If successful, specify exactly what supplies were acquired (be specific, nothing vague), and explain how they will assist in achieving the player's goal.
- If the gathering was partially successful or failed, explain what was obtained, if anything, and why certain supplies were not acquired.
- Reflect any costs incurred, such as time, money, resources spent, or potential risks taken.
