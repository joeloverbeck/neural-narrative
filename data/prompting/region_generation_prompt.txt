- What types of buildings or structures define the region? Are there iconic styles of art, sculpture, or architecture? Think of the cultural aesthetics and how they reflect the region's history.
- What form of governance exists here? Is it a monarchy, a theocracy, a republic, or something else? Is the region controlled by a council, warlords, or a democratic assembly?
- Is the region in a state of war or peace? Who are their allies and enemies? Do they have longstanding rivalries or uneasy alliances with neighboring realms?
- Are there factions, guilds, or clans vying for control? Could there be a secret organization pulling the strings behind the scenes?
- What resources define the region? What goods are highly sought after?

- How do people move within the region and beyond?
- What is the social hierarchy? Are there distinct classes, like nobility, mages, warriors, and commoners?
