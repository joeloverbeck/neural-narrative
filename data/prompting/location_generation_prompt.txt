- What is valuable in the location? From ores to rare flora, what can be mined, harvested, or stolen?
- Natural dangers inherent to the location. Avalanches, rockfalls, sudden storms, or even aggressive flora/fauna.
- What is the emotional or atmospheric tone of the location? Is it a place of foreboding, peace, or mystery? This can influence the reader's perception.
- What is the primary function of the location today? Is it a training ground for warriors, a mining operation, or a forbidden area only entered under dire circumstances?
